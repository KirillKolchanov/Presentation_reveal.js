							The Agile method has gained momentum as a top choice for leaders and developers alike. And it's no surprise why.
							Here are just a few key benefits of Agile project management and Agile development:<br><br>
							Greater stakeholder engagement and collaboration: Agile encourages a high degree of input and collaboration between the client and development team. This leads to happier clients because there is transparency throughout the process and developers are better informed on client needs and wants.<br><br>
							Predictable costs and scheduling: By breaking down the development process into iterative sprints, project managers can more accurately estimate costs and set clear, predictable timelines. This makes stakeholders happier because they know what to expect and can plan budgets and marketing strategies more precisely.<br><br>
							Flexibility amidst change: Agile project management is all about being nimble so teams can adapt to changes quickly while reducing sunk costs.<br><br>
							Higher quality products: Agile product development integrates regular testing into the development process.<br><br>
							Reduced risk and faster ROI: Agile reduces risk because it regularly tests and allows for change mid-development.<br><br>

							Agile is a guiding philosophy that can be applied to various development models. Here are four of the most popular types of Agile methods: <br><br>
								Scrum is an Agile framework that focuses on cross-functional teamwork, accountability, and iteration in order to develop, deliver, and support complex products.<br><br>
								Kanban is an agile model designed to help teams work together more effectively. It follows three guiding principles:<br>
								Visualize your workflow.<br>
								Limit the amount of work in progress.<br>
								Organize the workflow based on priority.<br><br>
								Extreme Programming is the most specific Agile framework for software development practices. It aims to not only produce high-quality software but to make the entire process easier on the development team itself.<br><br>
								Feature Driven Development - is a client-centric Agile methodology tool that focuses on incremental development and status reporting across all levels. This approach helps prevent two of the biggest roadblocks in software development: confusion and rework.

							Scrum is precisely an evolution of Agile Management. Scrum is based on a set of very defined practices and roles that must be involved during the software development process. It is a flexible method, that rewards the application of the 12 agile principles in a context agreed by all the team members of the product.<br><br>
							Scrum is executed in temporary blocks that are short and periodic, called Sprints, which usually range from 2 to 4 weeks, which is the term for feedback and reflection. Each Sprint is an entity in itself, that is, it provides a complete result, a variation of the final product that must be able to be delivered to the client with the least possible effort when requested.
